### My programming experience:
As a programmer i consider myself a "novice" even though im in **my _fourth year_ at UCSD**, im very slow when it comes to writing algorithims, but if i have enough time i believe i can figure anything out. As a matter of fact i never programmed until i came to UCSD and yet ive made it this far which i think says a lot. Heres some of the codes that i learned today thanks to this assignment that i thought i would never use:  `git commit`, `git push`. One of my favorite lines of code to write is a `print` statement so i can check if my code actually works.  
### A bit about me:
In the words of the **Great Kendrick Lamar** I think of myself as an: 
> _antisocial extrovert_ 
>
meaning that when im around people im comfortable with im very social but when i first meet you i often seem rude or disintrested. 
### Interests:
- Gaming
- Working on cars
- listening to music
- sports
- exercising
- and anything i can do with my hands.
 
**Over the years ive taken apart and put back together many things, some of which worked after, and majority that didnt.**

### Pets:
I love animals and ive had a number of pets, but the ones that stuck around were my cats and my dogs. _*Disclaimer: The following lists are not in order of my love for these animals because i love all them equally._

3. Minnie
4. Cocoa
   
The cats are named:

### Some Fun Links:
- Here's the link to my first ever git repo: [TonyV12](https://github.com/ToniV12/GitHub-Pages-Project/tree/main).
- This is the link to a [Meme](UnitTestMeme.png) about unit Testing that i thought was funny

>I would like to pass this class with a good grade and hopefully learn a lot more about software engineering as well so this list will be updated when those two tasks have been accomplished.
- [ ] Got a good grade.
- [ ] Learned a great deal.
- [ ] Learned a moderate amount.
- [ ] Learned a small amount.
